# Survival-Island

My first game made on the Unity 3.x
Short game that can be finished in 15 minutes. The goal of the game is to light the campfire which will help us to call for help. To do this, we must find three power cells which will let us open the door to the house in which there are matches. In the game we will also have to throw coconuts at the shields.

Controls:
W, A, S, D - Walking
Space - Jump
LMB - coconut throw (in a designated place)
